# Getting Started

The Superfluid SDK provides TypeScript/JavaScript bindings for interacting with the Superfluid Protocol, enabling real-time finance applications with continuous money streams.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Node.js 18+ installed
- A package manager (npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun)
- Basic knowledge of TypeScript/JavaScript
- Understanding of Ethereum and smart contracts

## Installation

Install the Superfluid SDK using your preferred package manager:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @superfluid-finance/sdk viem wagmi
```

The SDK has peer dependencies on `viem` and `wagmi` which provide the underlying Ethereum interaction capabilities.

## Quick Start

Here's a minimal example to get you started with reading data from Superfluid:

```ts twoslash
import { superTokenAbi, superTokenAddress } from "@superfluid-finance/sdk"
import { createPublicClient, http } from "viem"
import { mainnet } from "viem/chains"

const client = createPublicClient({
  chain: mainnet,
  transport: http()
})

async function getBalance() {
  const balance = await client.readContract({
    address: superTokenAddress[mainnet.id]["USDCx"],
    abi: superTokenAbi,
    functionName: "balanceOf",
    args: ["0x..."] // Your address here
  })
  
  return balance
}
```

## Package Structure

The SDK is organized into three main import paths:

- **`@superfluid-finance/sdk`** - Core ABIs and addresses
- **`@superfluid-finance/sdk/actions`** - wagmi core actions for non-React usage
- **`@superfluid-finance/sdk/wagmi`** - React hooks for wagmi integration

## Next Steps
